Overall Architecture

We work in phases for two reasons: to manage the context of the LLM,
and to give users a chance to edit before moving on to the next phase.

Each phase represents one sequence of "messages" in the chat api.

generate_system_instruction
In general, we have a system prompt, which expands its context for each phase.

Phase 1: Story Base
Generate a story base
generate_story_base

Phase 2: Story Outline (single convo for a single story)
Generate a story outline, then edit and improve it.
generate_story_outline_step_1 — generate the one sentence outline of the story.
generate_story_outline_step_2 — generate the main events outline of the story.
generate_story_outline_step_3 — edit and improve the outline.
generate_story_outline_step_4 — expand the outline with a paragraph summary and notes.

Phase 2: Chapter Outlines (new convo for each chapter)
Generate chapter outlines for each chapter, then edit and improve them.
generate_chapter_outline_step_1 — generate a chapter outline.
generate_chapter_outline_step_2 — edit and improve the outline.

Phase 3: Scene Outlines (new convo for each scene)
Generate scene outlines for each scene, then edit and improve them.
This phase exists mostly to manage GPTs tendency to write short, summary style text instead of long form fiction.
generate_scene_outline_step_1 — generate a scene outline.
generate_scene_outline_step_2 — edit and improve the outline.

Phase 4: Write Scenes (new convo for each scene)
Write the scenes. Then edit and improve them.
Each call to one of these functions will require a new conversation so that we can optimize the context.
generate_scene_text_step_1 — generate the text for a scene.
generate_scene_text_step_2 — edit and improve the text.
